<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Tasty no-bake cookies made with quick-cooking oats, peanut butter, and cocoa. For best results, start timing when the mixture reaches a full rolling boil; this is the trick to successful cookies. If you boil too long the cookies will be dry and crumbly. If you don't boil long enough the cookies won't form properly.</p>
