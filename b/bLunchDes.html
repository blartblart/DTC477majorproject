<h2>Description</h2>
<p> The best tuna salad recipe with two secret ingredients: curry powder and Parmesan cheese! An odd combination but this makes a terrific tuna sandwich. I got this recipe from a friend who used it in her catering service business many years ago. She used it for an appetizer with gourmet crackers. It has been my favorite recipe for tuna salad for many, many years.</p>
