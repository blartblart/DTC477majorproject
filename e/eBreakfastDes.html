<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Breakfast kolaches are great when you need a portable breakfast. My family created this recipe that uses a bread machine to prepare the dough. The filling can be made with a variety of things â€” we like to use sausage, cheese, and hash browns. I fill the kolaches the night before and keep them in the refrigerator overnight. In the morning, I bring the kolaches to room temperature while the oven is preheating and then cook them for a quick, hot breakfast.</p>
